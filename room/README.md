# Known Issues
> *Sometimes when I move, it will continue in that direction after I let go. How do I stop that?*

Occasionally, when multiple keys are pressed at once and then released, it may fail to register one of the key releases, causing a “stuck” movement. If this happens, simply press the key corresponding to the stuck direction (for example, press **D** if you’re stuck moving right) to fix it.

> *My cursor is no longer attached to the experience. How do I reattach myself?*

If you switch browsers or press **ESC**, your cursor will become unlocked from the experience. To reattach it, simply **Left-Click** anywhere inside the window to lock back in.
